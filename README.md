# University of Nebraska-Lincoln Website Clone

Welcome to my University of Nebraska-Lincoln Website Clone! ðŸŽ“

I'm excited to showcase my skills in web development through this project. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've recreated the essence of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's website, integrating its images, information, descriptions, and logos to create an authentic experience.

## Project Overview

This project was primarily aimed at testing my problem-solving abilities and demonstrating proficiency in converting design concepts into functional code. Throughout the development process, I utilized modern web development techniques, including grid layouts for two-dimensional structures and flexbox for one-dimensional layouts, to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Current Status

While the website is not yet fully responsive, I'm actively working on enhancing its responsiveness to ensure seamless accessibility across various devices and screen sizes.

## Disclaimer

It's important to note that all images, logos, and videos used in this project are sourced from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, except a few obtained from platforms like Unsplash and Pexels for additional features and design elements.

Thank you for visiting my University of Nebraska-Lincoln Website Clone, and I hope you enjoy exploring the content as much as I enjoyed creating it!
